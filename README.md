 🔧 How It Works

🎼 Key → Sound Mapping

Each letter has an ASCII code:

Song ID = ASCII(key) - 37


Example:

| Key | ASCII | Sound-ID | Plays  |
| --- | ----- | -------- | ------ |
| A   | 65    | 28       | 28.mp3 |
| B   | 66    | 29       | 29.mp3 |
| …   | …     | …        | …      |


 🛠️ Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6)
* REMIXICON (Icons)
* Custom MP3 assets
